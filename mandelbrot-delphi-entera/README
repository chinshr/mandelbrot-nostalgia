                              Entera Fractal Demo
                                  Entera 4.01
                              --------------------

===============
1  Introduction
=============== 

This demo calculates a mandelbrot set. Depending on the client settings the
fractal will be calculated remotely.  This demo is supposed to demonstrate
the performance behavior of Entera 4.x. A report shows the runtime behavior
of the demo after the calculation of the mandelbrot set.

================
2  Prerequisites
================

   Install Entera 4.01 (important: apply the Delphi 4.01 patch)

On Win32: 

   Install Delphi 4.0
   Install either Borland C++ Builder (1 or 2) or MS C++ (4 or 5)

On Unix:

   Make sure that the C compilers are installed correctly.   

Important: Please add all of these products to the environment path. For
           Entera have the ODEDIR variable set to the Entera directory.   

======================
3  Compile the Sources
======================

Generate stubs with:

  obigen -p fractal.ddp

Compile the server (change to server directory):

   On Unix:

      make

   On Win32 with Borland C++ Builder:
   
      make -f bcc.mak

   On Win32 with MS C++:

      nmake -f mscc.mak

Compile the client (change to client directory):

   make -f dcc.mak

===============
4  Start Server
===============

Change to server directory. Modify your fractal.dap attribute file
appropriately (see Entera Reference Manual):

   On Unix:

      fracsrv &

   On Win32:

      start fracsrv

===============
5  Start Client
===============

Change to client directory. Modify your fractal.dap attribute file
appropriately (see Entera Reference Manual):

   Fractal

A user interface will show up on screen. If you start the process, the
fractal will be calculated on the server. A statistical report will give
details about the runtime behavior of the demo.
